# Spritez
Simple sprite implementation to draw into any canvas. This is just my playground with browser canvas animations, there are plenty other mature implementations available or frameworks for gaming development, consider searching for them if you are in a real game dev situation.

## Requirements
- Node v10 or higher;
- NPM v6 or higher.


## Features
- Multi sprite support;
- Only one instance is necessary for different animations of the same object;
- Highly configurable.


## Samples
Code samples are available in `samples/` folder.

## Sprites
Got all sprites for free on [itch.io](https://itch.io/) and adjusted them with [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/). Sprites in use:
- [Red hood](https://legnops.itch.io/red-hood-character);
- [Ghoul](https://elthen.itch.io/2d-pixel-art-ghoul-sprites);
- [Tree](https://graphscriptdev.itch.io/tree-pixel-art).

## Running
Run `npm run dev` to watch and build all source files. For sample running execute `npm run samples` together.
